  <p> I got into the US 10 months ago, and I am really enjoying it. The fact of living a life in other language, being
    able to not only learn about the classes that I am taking but also about the culture I am livng in, it is something
    that I am really grateful for. I am so excited to see what te future holds form me. </p>
